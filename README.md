# Vanilla Forums Valet Driver

[Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet) configures your Mac as a PHP development environment. It provides support for many frameworks that use special URL rewriting and directory structures, but [Vanilla](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla) isn't in that list yet.

The `VanillaValetDriver` class you see here enables pretty URLs for Vanilla with Laravel Valet.

## Installation

Place the `VanillaValetDriver.php` file into `~/.config/valet/Drivers` directory on your Mac. That's all!
